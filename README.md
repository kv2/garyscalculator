Gary's Calculator

This app enables the sizing of simple foundations such as slab on grade, linear spread footing, column pad footing, end bearing pile, and side friction deep foundations. Taking into account various building design parameters as well as soil types and design loads, the app will output desired and CBC 2016 compliant foundation sizes.

Project completed per California State Polytechnic University Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) Professor Gary McGavin's instructions. Scope of project is a program to ease calculation of common foundations for simplified designs.
